# spotify

just playing around with spotipy

## some random notes

- look up song uris
- different spotify scopes are needed to do different stuff -- sometimes they encode the webpage response thing and sometimes they don't
  - encoded if trying to see if a user is active
  - not encoded if trying to add a song to queue
  - not encoded if doing both
